# SheOnChainBootcamp
An education based platform based on blockchain, deployed on sepolia testnet for RiseIn SheOnChainBootCamp.

The repository consists of two contracts:
- Certificate.sol
- NFTMarketplace.sol


Certificate is a small smart contract which acts like a function to handle certificates, while NFTMarketplace has a clear code on how to get, list and update NFTs.
